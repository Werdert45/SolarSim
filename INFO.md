# PWS Why Making Long Term Predictions Is So Difficult
******

This PWS is my final project for High School and combines **Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics**. The project describes the difficulty of making predictions because of chaos and tries to find an answer for how big the initial values of a predictions are on the result over a long time, by looking at a simulation of the solar system. what does this simulation give for values over a long time? and most importantly, __how does chaos behave here?__.

## Summary

The Project is divided in a few chapters
 1. Two body Problem
 2. N-Body Problem
 3. Chaos
 4. Numerical Methods
 5. Predictions
 6. Deviation and Discussion
 7. Conclusion
